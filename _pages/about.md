# ✨ About me

Hi, this is Michael. Welcome to my homepage! Currently, I am a master’s student in biomedical engineering at the [State Key Laboratory of Ultrasound in Medicine and Engineering (SKL-UME)](https://skl-ume.cqmu.edu.cn/), [Chongqing Medical University (CQMU)](https://www.cqmu.edu.cn/), China. During my undergraduate studies, with the supervision of Dr.Wang Li, I focused on embedded system and medical artificial intelligence in [Chongqing University of Technology (CQUT)](https://www.cqut.edu.cn/). Now, I am supervised by Dr.Tianqi Shan and Dr.Yuan Zhao to conduct research in photoacoustic imaging based on deep learning.
Additionally, I am also interested in movies, music, digital and soccer. You can find me spending my free time exploring the latest movies, enjoying a good soccer game, discovering new music or researching the latest digital products. I believe that a well-rounded life is essential to fostering creativity and innovation. In short, living a colorful life and contributing to the world would be my life-long pursuit. **"Life is about creating yourself."-George Bernard Shaw**.
