# ✨ About me
Hi, this is Michael. Welcome to my homepage! Currently, I am a master’s student in BME at the [State Key Laboratory of Ultrasound in Medicine and Engineering (SKL-UME)](https://skl-ume.cqmu.edu.cn/), [Chongqing Medical University (CQMU)](https://www.cqmu.edu.cn/), China. During my undergraduate studies, with the supervision of [Dr.Wang Li](https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=56245514200), I focused on embedded system and medical artificial intelligence in [Chongqing University of Technology (CQUT)](https://www.cqut.edu.cn/). Now, I am supervised by [Dr.Tianqi](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2297-1636) Shan and [Dr.Yuan Zhao](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0549-6407) to conduct research on intelligent robot-assisted photoacoustic imaging.
I am particularly interested in artificial intelligence and electronic technology. I also have hobbies in film, music, digital and soccer. I believe that a well-rounded life is essential for fostering creativity and innovation. In short, keep learning and making my own contribution to the world would be my life-long pursuit. **"Stay hungry, stay foolish."-Steve Jobs**.
