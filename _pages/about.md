# ‚ú® About me
Hi, this Wanrong. Welcome to my wonderland! Currently, I am a PhD student in computer science at [EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training (CDT)](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/distributed-algorithms-cdt/), Which is a fansnating place to generate future leader in data science and arifical intelligence. Before this, I obtained my bechelor's degree in Biomedical Engineering with highest honor from joint education of [Chongqing University of Technology(CQUT)](https://www.cqut.edu.cn/) and [Shenzhen Institute of Adcanced Technology(SIAT)](https://www.siat.ac.cn/), Chinese Academy of Sciences(CAS). During my undergraduate study, with the supervision of Dr.Wang Li and Dr.Shengping Liu,I focused on medical signal processing and electronic nose. After that, I was supervised by [Dr.Yihang Zhou](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=l_O7i1oAAAAJ&hl=en), [Dr.Haifeng Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Ao4Q2uAAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and [Dr.Dong Liang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3cAJWoIAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) to conduct MR-guided radiotherapy in prostate cancer and AI for fast MR imaging in SIAT. Now, I am supervised by [Dr.Dominik Wojtczak](https://www.csc.liv.ac.uk/~dominik/) and [Dr.Sven Schewe](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/computer-science/staff/sven-schewe/), cooperated with [Dr.Stephen Pasteris](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=mqtdKfkAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao) from [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/) to explor new AI technology for cybersecurity. If you are interested in my research, please drop me an email üì¨ **Wanrong.Yang@liverpool.ac.uk**
